            <p class="text-small">Literacy in India is a key for socio-economic progress. Despite government programmes,
                India's literacy rate increased only "sluggishly". The 2011 census, indicated a 2001–2011 decadal
                literacy growth of 9.2%, which is slower than the growth seen during the previous decade. An old
                analytical 1990 study estimated that it would take until 2060 for India to achieve universal literacy at
                then-current rate of progress.

                Census of India pegged average literacy rate to be 73% in 2011 while National Statistical Commission
                surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017–18. Literacy rate in urban areas was higher 87.7% than rural areas
                with 73.5%. There is a wide gender disparity in the literacy rate in India and effective literacy rates
                (age 7 and above) was 84.7% for men and 70.3% for women.[6] The low female literacy rate has a
                dramatically negative impact on family planning and population stabillisation efforts in India.</p>
